Codetest from Ludvig Lindqvist

Hi!

Time ran out, tooltips without libraries was harder than I thought...

Some thoughts:

Wanted to get the logic in place before styling - could've managed the time better.

Made a lot of errors since rusty after vacay - which consumed a lot of the time.

HTML5 video-player bugged a bit in Chrome but worked in Firefox/Safari

Fun exercise for practicing DOM-manipulation! 

Best regards,
Ludvig Lindqvist
