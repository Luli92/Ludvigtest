Codetest from Ludvig Lindqvist

Hi!

Time ran out, tooltips without libraries was harder than I thought...

*Wanted to get the logic in place before styling 
*Made a lot of errors since rusty after vacay - which consumed a lot of the time.
*HTML5 video-player bugged a bit in Chrome but worked in Firefox/Safari

Fun exercise for practicing DOM-manipulation! 

Best regards,
Ludvig Lindqvist
